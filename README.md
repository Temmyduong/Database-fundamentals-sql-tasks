# Database-fundamentals-sql-tasks

## Project Overview
This repository showcases a collection of SQL and database modelling tasks completed for the MIS771 – Database Fundamentals unit at Deakin University. The project covers the full database development lifecycle, including:
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) design
- Data normalisation (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- SQL table creation with constraints
- Data insertion and updates
- Complex SQL querying with joins, subqueries, aggregation
- View creation, index management, and basic data manipulation
Through these tasks, I have developed hands-on skills in relational database design and data manipulation using standard SQL syntax.

In addition, this project involved working with a variety of database tools and platforms, including:
- MySQL Workbench – for designing schemas, running SQL queries, and visualising ERDs
- SQLite – for lightweight local testing of SQL logic
- Oracle Database (via Oracle Live SQL or Oracle SQL Developer) – to practise queries in a professional-grade enterprise environment
- DBDiagram.io and Lucidchart – to model conceptual ER diagrams using Crow's Foot notation
These tools provided valuable experience with both open-source and enterprise database systems, improving my versatility and adaptability as a database practitioner.
